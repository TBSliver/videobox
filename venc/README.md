What's here?

 * artwork & video: artwork for the video background, preroll and postroll
 * stream2vfo.sh: microdaemon, watches a dir for incoming encoding job descriptions and calls stream2vfo.sh
 * transcode_2016.sh: the actual transcoding step
 * performance_test.sh: how fast will encodes work on this system
 * example.txt: example job

Problems? Questions? Ask Mark (mvandenborre@fosdem.org), Gerry (gerry@fosdem.org) or Jaron (thulinma@fosdem.org).

Notes:
 * Some paths are hardcoded, look into stream2vfo.sh before using it;
 * transcode_2016.sh uses a new layout with some overlapping of the slides and camera feeds, different from the original one (which can be found in transcode_2016.sh.backup)
